    "Abortion has been a hot button issue in the United States for decades. In the historic Roe v. Wade case in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a woman's right to choose to have an abortion is protected by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amdendment. In very recent news in May 2022, a draft of a Supreme Court opinion that would overturn the Roe v. Wade decision was leaked to the media. Some states have already criminalized abortion, and some policy makers are moving to criminalize abortion federally across the United States. This is a human rights issue, and specifically a women's rights issue of bodily autonomy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through research, I hope to better understand individuals' perspectives on abortion in the United States and whether any differences exist along gender lines. I also hope to see if the actions of policy makers reflect the opinions of the general public. In addition, because abortion legislation affects women directly and men indirectly, and men outnumber women in policy-making positions, I'm interested to see the gender distribution of anti-abortion legislators. I hope to determine whether policy makers are adequately representing the wishes of the general public on the issue of abortion. This research aims to determine whether our democracy is truly representative on this issue, and whether differences in opinion along gender lines play a role in related legislation.\n",

    "When I presenting my intial ideas about this research topic to my peers, they encouraged me to look closely at those with the power to make policy decisions and their gender distribution."

    "**Examining the Absence of a Gender Effect on Abortion Attitudes: Is There Really No Difference?** by Hertel and Russell\n",
    "\n",
    "ABSTRACT:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Earlier research on attitudes toward abortion has found little or no difference between men and women. To the limited extent that there is any gender effect, men are slightly more inclined than women to be prochoice (e.g., Cook, Jelen, and Wilcox 1992). Women, however, have been found to regard the issue as more important (Scott and Schuman 1988). The present study uses General Social Survey data from 1972 through 1994 to further explore gender and attitudes toward abortion. We find that within three marital statuses–single, married, widowed–men are somewhat more supportive of abortion rights but that women consider the issue to be more important and have clearer but not necessarily stronger attitudes than men. When differences in workforce participation are controlled, the sex effect is reversed, with women being more prochoice than men. Although significantly related to abortion attitudes, race, marital status, and religious identity are not relevant to this reversal in the sex effect.\n",

    "This article includes a literature review establishing that previous research indicates there is no significant effect of gender on abortion attitudes. Based on General Social Survey data from 1972 to 1994, there is practically no relationship between gender and abortion attitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe there is still value in checking for an effect of gender on abortion attitudes with more recent data, and my selected dataset for this topic is over ten years newer than the data used by Hertel and Russel. As such, I will continue with my analysis of abortion sentiment along gender lines.\n",

    "\n",
    "This book includes an analysis of General Social Survey data through 1991, also reporting that virtually no relationship exists between gender and abortion attitudes. They find that if a limited effect does exist, women are actually slightly less supportive of legal abortion than men (p. 44).\n",
    "\n",
    "My H2 and H3 were originally that men would be significantly more likely to oppose abortion rights than women, whether members of the legislature or general public. I reasoned that since abortion rights are a matter of women's bodily autonomy, more women would support their right to choose, whereas men would be have an easier time opposing abortion on philosophical grounds as it doesn't directly affect their rights. Given the results from this study, I changed my hypotheses to see if a significant difference exists along gender lines in either direction. The data used in the Cook et al. study is now over thirty years old, so I believe it is still valuable to test these hypotheses with more modern data. If any differences exist, it will suggest a change in the gender effects on abortion sentiment from 1991 to today."
