    "This study investigates the effect of gender on opinion of abortion legality in legislators and the general public. Prior studies in the early 1990s have found no significant relationship between gender and abortion attitudes, and this study sets to discover if a relationship exists with more modern data from the mid 2000s. Attitudes of both the general public and legislators are examined to determine if legislators are representative of the public on this issue. Using data from a public poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, as well as data on legislators' abortion bill sponsorship in 21 states, the proportions of men and women who hold different stances on abortion were compared. While some nuance exists in different opinions, it was found that women generally supported abortion rights more often than men in both the public and policymaking positions. In addition, the proportion of legislators who supported anti-abortion as opposed to pro-abortion bills significantly exceeded the proportion of people in the public who held anti-abortion as opposed to pro-abortion beliefs. Implications of these findings on legislative representation and women's role in public policymaking are discussed."

    "Abortion has been a hot button issue in the United States for decades. In the historic Roe v. Wade case in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a woman's right to choose to have an abortion is protected by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amdendment. In very recent news in May 2022, a draft of a Supreme Court opinion that would overturn the Roe v. Wade decision was leaked to the media. Some states have already criminalized abortion, and some policy makers are moving to criminalize abortion federally across the United States. This is a human rights issue, and specifically a women's rights issue of bodily autonomy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through research, I hope to better understand individuals' perspectives on abortion in the United States and whether any differences exist along gender lines. I also hope to see if the actions of policy makers reflect the opinions of the general public. In addition, because abortion legislation affects women directly and men indirectly, and men outnumber women in policy-making positions, I'm interested to see the gender distribution of anti-abortion legislators. I hope to determine whether policy makers are adequately representing the wishes of the general public on the issue of abortion. This research aims to determine whether our democracy is truly representative on this issue, and whether differences in opinion along gender lines play a role in related legislation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I presenting my intial ideas about this research topic to my peers, they encouraged me to look closely at those with the power to make policy decisions and their gender distribution."

    "**Examining the Absence of a Gender Effect on Abortion Attitudes: Is There Really No Difference?** by Hertel and Russell\n",
    "\n",
    "ABSTRACT:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Earlier research on attitudes toward abortion has found little or no difference between men and women. To the limited extent that there is any gender effect, men are slightly more inclined than women to be prochoice (e.g., Cook, Jelen, and Wilcox 1992). Women, however, have been found to regard the issue as more important (Scott and Schuman 1988). The present study uses General Social Survey data from 1972 through 1994 to further explore gender and attitudes toward abortion. We find that within three marital statuses–single, married, widowed–men are somewhat more supportive of abortion rights but that women consider the issue to be more important and have clearer but not necessarily stronger attitudes than men. When differences in workforce participation are controlled, the sex effect is reversed, with women being more prochoice than men. Although significantly related to abortion attitudes, race, marital status, and religious identity are not relevant to this reversal in the sex effect.\n",

    "This article includes a literature review establishing that previous research indicates there is no significant effect of gender on abortion attitudes. Based on General Social Survey data from 1972 to 1994, there is practically no relationship between gender and abortion attitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe there is still value in checking for an effect of gender on abortion attitudes with more recent data, and my selected dataset for this topic is over ten years newer than the data used by Hertel and Russel. As such, I will continue with my analysis of abortion sentiment along gender lines.\n",

    "This book includes an analysis of General Social Survey data through 1991, also reporting that virtually no relationship exists between gender and abortion attitudes. They find that if a limited effect does exist, women are actually slightly less supportive of legal abortion than men (p. 44).\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypotheses were originally that men would be significantly more likely to oppose abortion rights than women, whether members of the legislature or general public. I reasoned that since abortion rights are a matter of women's bodily autonomy, more women would support their right to choose, whereas men may have an easier time opposing abortion on philosophical grounds as it doesn't directly affect their rights. Given the results from this study, I changed my hypotheses to see if a significant difference exists along gender lines in either direction. The data used in the Cook et al. study is now over thirty years old, so I believe it is still valuable to test these hypotheses with more modern data. Any existing differences will suggest a change in the gender effects on abortion sentiment from 1991 to the 2000s."

    "#### H1\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportion of respondents to the public poll dataset who supported an anti-abortion stance was significantly less than the proportion of legislators who supported anti-abortion as opposed to pro-abortion bills. This suggests that policymakers do not represent the public's wishes well on the issue of abortion rights, instead taking more of an anti-abortion stance than the general population.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this analysis only included legislators who supported either a pro-abortion bill or an anti-abortion bill. Many legislators did not support either kind of bill, and were excluded from analysis. Some of the legislators excluded may take stances on abortion, but did not support particular bills for different reasons. Others may hold a generally pro-abortion stance, but not support specifc pro-abortion bills because they believe abortion access is adequately assured by the Roe v. Wade precedent. It would be reasonable that legislators who disagree with Roe v. Wade and abortion rights would attempt to pass bills to limit abortion access, while supporters of Roe v. Wade may be satisfied with the current state of abortion rights in this country. Though H1 was supported and this finding was signficant, these limitations may decrease its validity. More research could be done to poll legislators for their abortion opinions, rather than using bill sponsorship as a proxy for abortion stance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### H2\n",
    "\n",
    "Male and female respondents to the public opinion poll agreed with the statements, \"Abortion should be legal in most cases,\" and, \"Abortion should always be illegal,\" in essentially the same proportions. Therefore, the proportion of men and women who are staunchly against abortion rights is equal, and the proportion of men and women who are generally in support of abortion rights is equal. However, women were more likely than men to support abortion legality for any reason. Also, men were more likely than women to say abortion should be illegal in most cases. Though some nuance exists in these findings, it is reasonable to conclude that women are more likely to support legal abortion than men. The implication of this on public policy is that, if more women held policymaking positions, there may be more support for pro-abortion legislation. This implication is further supported by the other significant finding in H3.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the 'Data Limitations' section above, this dataset is biased towards the political views of ABC News and the Washington Post's audience. To increase the validity of these findings, bigger public polls from a greater variety of sources could be included in analysis to better estimate the views of the general public.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### H3\n",
    "\n",
    "Though male and female legislators supported anti-abortion rights bills in essentially equal proportions, female legislators were more likely to support pro-abortion rights bills than male legislators. This, coupled with the significant findings of H2.1 and H2.3, suggests that if more women held policymaking positions, it may lead to more governmental support for pro-abortion bills. Because H1 demonstrated that a much greater proportion of policymakers support anti-abortion rights bills than the general public, having more individuals with a pro-abortion rights stance in policymaking positions could better represent the public's stance on this issue. These findings therefore imply that having more women in policymaking positions could make legislators as a whole more representative of the public on the issue of abortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the 'Data Limitations' section above, these findings are derived from data on only 21 U.S. states. It's possible this data is not representative of the entire United States, and more research could improve the validity of these findings with more data on legislators from all over the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation of this analysis is the exclusion of political party from the analysis. Existing political parties take different stances on abortion, with conservative Republicans typically holding an anti-abortion rights stance and liberal Democrats typically holding a pro-abortion rights stance. The effect of more female legislators supporting pro-abortion bills may be because more female legislators are members of the democratic party. Analysis of political party was outside of the scope of this project, but further research could take it into account to present a clearer picture of abortion sentiment among legislators."

    "This research set out to discover if legislators oppose abortion rights in a greater proportion than the general public, and whether differences in opinion on abortion legality exist along gender lines for both legislators and the general public. It was found that the proportion of legislators who supported anti-abortion bills as opposed to pro-abortion bills was significantly greater than the proportion of public poll respondents who thought abortion should be illegal most or all of the time. It was then found that an equal proportion of men and women in the public believe abortion should be legal most of the time and illegal all of the time. However, a significantly greater proportion of women agreed abortion should be legal in all cases, and a significantly greater proportion of men agreed abortion should be illegal in most cases. The final finding was that, while male and female legislators support anti-abortion bills in equal proportions, a significantly greater proportion of female legislators supported pro-abortion rights bills. These findings suggest that women are more likely to support abortion rights whether they are legislators or members of the general public. As such, the pro-abortion rights sentiment of the general public may be better represented in the government if more legislators were women."
