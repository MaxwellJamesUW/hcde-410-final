# hcde-410-final
This folder contains process work for the final project of HCDE410, Human Data Interaction class.

The proposed final project is an analysis of policy makers' and public survey respondents' opinions on abortion and their gender distribution for that issue.

The proportion of policy makers who oppose abortion rights will be compared to the proportion of people in the general public who oppose abortion rights. The proportion of men and women who oppose abortion will also be compared for both the general public and people in policymaking positions.
